    "### Heading The assumptions are listed below - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Samples generated by the users are of variable sizes.\n",
    "2. When they are sent to the scheduler, scheduler breaks these samples down into uniforma sized packets. So effectively every component may generate different number of packets to transmit.\n",
    "3. Every RB can transmit 1 packet at a time. Bo Zhou's papers and many other follow this.\n",
    "4. If a component has packets from different samples and enough RBs are available to support them, only the packets from the old sample will be transmitted first. The remaining RBs will then be allocated to the next users. So bottomline is that at any time, only packets belonging to the same sample will be considered for transmission.\n",
    "5. A sample is fully transmitted only when all the packets belonging to the sample is delivered. So Age will reduce only the whole sample is transferred completely. First considered in <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8761311>\n",
    "6. No packet loss is being considered now - a RB allocated to a packet means that packet will be delivered for sure."
